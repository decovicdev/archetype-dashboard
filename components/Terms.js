        <b>1.1. Account Creation.</b> In order to use certain features of the
        Services, you must register for an account (<b>“Account”</b>) and
        provide certain information about yourself as prompted by the account
        registration form. For purposes of these Terms, a{' '}
        <b>“Third-Party Account”</b> is a valid account on a third-party website
        or service through which the user has connected to the Services. You
        represent and warrant that: (a) all required registration information
        you submit is truthful and accurate; and (b) you will maintain the
        accuracy of such information. If you provide any information that is
        untrue, inaccurate, not current or incomplete, or Lantern has reasonable
        grounds to suspect that any information you provide is untrue,
        inaccurate, not current or incomplete, Lantern has the right to suspend
        or terminate your Account and refuse any and all current or future use
        of Services (or any portion thereof). Lantern may also suspend or
        terminate your Account in accordance with Section 10. You may delete
        your Account at any time, for any reason, by following the instructions

        <b>1.2. Access Through a Third-Party Service.</b> If you access the
        Services through a third-party website or service as part of the
        functionality of the Site, the Mobile App and/or the Services, you may
        link your Account with Third-Party Accounts, by allowing Lantern to
        access your Third-Party Account, as is permitted under the applicable
        terms and conditions that govern your use of each Third-Party Account.
        You represent that you are entitled to disclose your Third-Party Account
        login information to Lantern and/or grant Lantern access to your
        Third-Party Account (including, but not limited to, for use for the
        purposes described herein) without breach by you of any of the terms and
        conditions that govern your use of the applicable Third-Party Account
        and without obligating Lantern to pay any fees or making Lantern subject
        to any usage limitations imposed by such third-party service providers.
        By granting Lantern access to any Third-Party Accounts, you understand
        that Lantern may access, make available and store (if applicable) any
        information, data, text, software, music, sound, photographs, graphics,
        video, messages, tags and/or other materials accessible through the
        Services (collectively, <b>“Content”</b>) that you have provided to and
        stored in your Third-Party Account (<b>“Third-Party Content”</b>) so
        that it is available on and through Services via your Account. Unless
        otherwise specified in these Terms, all Third-Party Content shall be
        considered to be User Content (as defined in Section 3.1 (User Content))
        for all purposes of these Terms. Depending on the Third-Party Accounts
        you choose and subject to the privacy settings that you have set in such
        Third-Party Accounts, personally identifiable information that you post
        to your Third-Party Accounts may be available on and through your
        Account on the Services. Please note that if a Third-Party Account or
        associated service becomes unavailable, or Lantern’s access to such
        Third-Party Account is terminated by the third-party service provider,
        then Third-Party Content will no longer be available on and through the
        Services. You have the ability to disable the connection between your
        Account and your Third-Party Accounts at any time by accessing the
        “Settings” section of the Mobile App. PLEASE NOTE THAT YOUR RELATIONSHIP
        WITH THE THIRD-PARTY SERVICE PROVIDERS ASSOCIATED WITH YOUR THIRD-PARTY
        ACCOUNTS IS GOVERNED SOLELY BY YOUR AGREEMENT(S) WITH SUCH THIRD-PARTY
        SERVICE PROVIDERS, AND LANTERN DISCLAIMS ANY LIABILITY FOR PERSONALLY
        IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION THAT MAY BE PROVIDED TO IT BY SUCH THIRD-PARTY
        SERVICE PROVIDERS IN VIOLATION OF THE PRIVACY SETTINGS THAT YOU HAVE SET
        IN SUCH THIRD-PARTY ACCOUNTS. Lantern makes no effort to review any
        Third-Party Content for any purpose, including but not limited to, for
        accuracy, legality or noninfringement, and Lantern is not responsible
        for any Third-Party Content.

        (defined below), you acknowledge that all the intellectual property
        rights, including copyrights, patents, trade marks, and trade secrets,

      <h3>3. User Content</h3>
      <p>
        <b>3.1. User Content. “User Content”</b> means any and all information
        and content that a user submits to, or uses with, the Services (e.g.,
        content in the user’s profile or postings). You are solely responsible
        for your User Content. You assume all risks associated with use of your
        User Content, including any reliance on its accuracy, completeness or
        usefulness by others, or any disclosure of your User Content that
        personally identifies you or any third party. You hereby represent and
        warrant that your User Content does not violate our Acceptable Use
        Policy (defined in Section 3.5). You may not represent or imply to
        others that your User Content is in any way provided, sponsored or
        endorsed by Lantern. Because you alone are responsible for your User
        Content, you may expose yourself to liability if, for example, your User
        Content violates the Acceptable Use Policy (as defined below). Lantern
        is not obligated to backup any User Content, and your User Content may
        be deleted at any time with or without prior notice. You are solely
        responsible for creating and maintaining your own backup copies of your
        User Content if you desire.

      <p>
        <b>3.2. No Obligation to Pre-Screen Content.</b> You acknowledge that
        Lantern has no obligation to pre-screen User Content, although Lantern
        reserves the right in its sole discretion to pre-screen, refuse or
        remove any User Content. By entering into these Terms, you hereby
        provide your irrevocable consent to such monitoring. You acknowledge and
        agree that you have no expectation of privacy concerning the
        transmission of User Content, including without limitation chat, text,
        or voice communications. In the event that Lantern pre-screens, refuses
        or removes any User Content, you acknowledge that Lantern will do so for
        Lantern’s benefit, not yours. Without limiting the foregoing, Lantern
        shall have the right to remove any User Content that violates these
        Terms or is otherwise objectionable to Lantern.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>3.3. User Content License. </b> You hereby grant (and you represent
        and warrant that you have the right to grant) to Lantern an irrevocable,
        nonexclusive, royalty-free and fully paid, worldwide license to
        reproduce, distribute, publicly display and perform, prepare derivative
        works of, incorporate into other works, and otherwise use and exploit
        your User Content, and to grant sublicenses of the foregoing rights,
        solely for the purposes of including your User Content in the Services.
        You hereby irrevocably waive (and agree to cause to be waived) any
        claims and assertions of moral rights or attribution with respect to
        your User Content.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>3.4. Aggregated User Data. </b> Notwithstanding anything to the
        contrary in these Terms, Lantern may monitor your use of the Services
        and collect and compile data and information related to your use of the
        Services which may be used by Lantern in an aggregate and anonymized
        manner (collectively, <b>“Aggregated User Data”</b>). As between you and
        Lantern, all right, title, and interest in Aggregated User Data, and all
        intellectual property rights therein, belong to and are retained solely
        by Lantern. You acknowledge that Lantern may compile Aggregated User
        Data based on User Content. You agree that Lantern may (i) make
        Aggregated User Data publicly available in compliance with applicable
        law, and (ii) use Aggregated User Data to the extent and in the manner
        permitted under applicable law; provided that such Aggregated User Data
        does not identify you or any of your personal information.

        liabilities. By providing Lantern with your credit card number or PayPal
        account and associated payment information, you agree that Lantern is
        authorized to immediately invoice your Account for all fees and charges
        due and payable to Lantern hereunder and that no additional notice or
        consent is required. You agree to immediately notify Lantern of any
        change in your billing address or the credit card or PayPal account used
        for payment hereunder. Lantern reserves the right at any time to change

        <b>4.2. Taxes. </b> If at any point in the future, Lantern begins to
        charge a fee for any of its Services (<b>“Fee(s)”</b>) and Lantern
        determines it has an obligation to collect Sales Tax from you in
        connection with these Terms, Lantern shall collect such Sales Tax in
        addition to the Fee(s). If any Services, or payments for any Services,
        under the Terms are subject to Sales Tax in any jurisdiction and you
        have not remitted the applicable Sales Tax to Lantern, you will be
        responsible for the payment of such Sales Tax and any related penalties
        or interest to the relevant authority, and you will indemnify Lantern
        for any liability or expense Lantern may incur in connection with such
        Sales Taxes. Upon Lantern’s request, you will provide it with official
        receipts issued by the appropriate taxing authority, or other such
        evidence that you have paid all applicable taxes. For purposes of this
        Section, “Sales Tax” shall mean any sales or use tax and any other tax
        measured by sales proceeds that is the functional equivalent of a sales
        tax where the applicable taxing jurisdiction does not otherwise impose a
        sales or use tax.

      <h3>5. Assumption of Risk Relating to Digital Assets</h3>
      <p>You acknowledge and agree that:</p>
      <p className="inner1">
        <b>(a)</b> The prices of digital assets are extremely volatile.
        Fluctuations in the price of other digital assets could materially and
        adversely affect the Items, which may also be subject to significant
        price volatility. We cannot and do not guarantee that any purchasers of
        digital assets will not lose money.
      </p>
      <p className="inner1">
        <b>(b)</b> You are solely responsible for determining what, if any,
        taxes apply to your transactions involving digital assets. Lantern is
        not responsible for determining the taxes that may apply to transactions
        involving digital assets.
      </p>
      <p className="inner1">
        <b>(c)</b> Digital assets exist and can be transferred only by virtue of
        the ownership record maintained on the blockchain supporting such
        digital assets.
      </p>
      <p className="inner1">
        <b>(d)</b> There are risks associated with using digital currency and
        digital assets, including but not limited to, the risk of hardware,
        software and Internet connections, the risk of malicious software
        introduction, and the risk that third parties may obtain unauthorized
        access to your information.
      </p>
      <p className="inner1">
        <b>(e)</b> The legal and regulatory regime governing blockchain
        technologies, cryptocurrencies, and tokens is uncertain, and new
        regulations or policies may materially adversely affect the development
        of the Services and the utility of digital assets.
      </p>
      <p className="inner1">
        <b>(f)</b> There are risks associated with purchasing user-generated
        digital assets or related content, including but not limited to, the
        risk of purchasing counterfeit assets, mislabeled assets, assets that
        are vulnerable to metadata decay, assets on smart contracts with bugs,
        and assets that may become untransferable.
      </p>
      <p className="inner1">
        <b>(g)</b> Lantern reserves the right to hide assets that Lantern
        suspects or believes may violate these Terms. Under no circumstances
        shall the inability to access or view your assets on the Service serve
        as grounds for a claim against Lantern.
      </p>
      <p className="inner1">
        <b>(h)</b> Lantern does not investigate and cannot guarantee or warrant
        the authenticity, originality, uniqueness, marketability, legality or
        value of any digital asset displayed on, promoted by or traded on the
        Services. For the avoidance of doubt, Lantern shall have no
        responsibility for any failure of any user to comply with any terms
        regarding the authenticity, originality, uniqueness, scarcity or other
        description or characteristics of any digital assets furnished by or on
        behalf of that user and displayed by Lantern on the Services.]

      <h3>6. Indemnification</h3>
      <p>
        You agree to indemnify and hold Lantern (and its officers, employees,
        and agents) harmless, including costs and attorneys’ fees, from any

        shall govern all aspects of the arbitration, including but not limited
        to the method of initiating and/or demanding arbitration, except to the
        extent such rules are in conflict with the Terms. The AAA Consumer
        Arbitration Rules (<b>“Arbitration Rules”</b>) governing the arbitration
        are available online at www.adr.org or by calling the AAA at
        1-800-778-7879. The arbitration shall be conducted by a single, neutral
        arbitrator. Any claims or disputes where the total amount of the award
        sought is less than Ten Thousand U.S. Dollars (US $10,000.00) may be
        resolved through binding non-appearance-based arbitration, at the option
        of the party seeking relief. For claims or disputes where the total
        amount of the award sought is Ten Thousand U.S. Dollars (US $10,000.00)
        or more, the right to a hearing will be determined by the Arbitration
        Rules. Any hearing will be held in a location within 100 miles of your
        residence, unless you reside outside of the United States, and unless
        the parties agree otherwise. If you reside outside of the U.S., the
        arbitrator shall give the parties reasonable notice of the date, time
        and place of any oral hearings. Any judgment on the award rendered by
        the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction. If
        the arbitrator grants you an award that is greater than the last
        settlement offer that Lantern made to you prior to the initiation of
        arbitration, Lantern will pay you the greater of the award or $2,500.00.
        Each party shall bear its own costs (including attorney’s fees) and
        disbursements arising out of the arbitration and shall pay an equal
        share of the fees and costs of the ADR Provider.

        <b>(d)</b> <i>Additional Rules for Non-Appearance Based Arbitration.</i>{' '}
        If non-appearance based arbitration is elected, the arbitration shall be
        conducted by telephone, online and/or based solely on written
        submissions; the specific manner shall be chosen by the party initiating
        the arbitration. The arbitration shall not involve any personal
        appearance by the parties or witnesses unless otherwise agreed by the
        parties.

      <p className="inner1">
        <b>(e)</b> <i>Time Limits.</i> If you or Lantern pursue arbitration, the
        arbitration action must be initiated and/or demanded within the statute
        of limitations (i.e., the legal deadline for filing a claim) and within
        any deadline imposed under the AAA Rules for the pertinent claim.
      </p>
      <p className="inner1">
        <b>(f)</b> <i>Authority of Arbitrator.</i> If arbitration is initiated,
        the arbitrator will decide the rights and liabilities, if any, of you
        and Lantern, and the dispute will not be consolidated with any other
        matters or joined with any other cases or parties. The arbitrator shall
        have the authority to grant motions dispositive of all or part of any
        claim. The arbitrator shall have the authority to award monetary
        damages, and to grant any non-monetary remedy or relief available to an
        individual under applicable law, the AAA Rules, and the Terms. The
        arbitrator shall issue a written award and statement of decision
        describing the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is
        based, including the calculation of any damages awarded. The arbitrator
        has the same authority to award relief on an individual basis that a
        judge in a court of law would have. The award of the arbitrator is final
        and binding upon you and Lantern.
