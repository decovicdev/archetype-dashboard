# What is Archetype? 
#### Everything you need to build and manage in-app purchases and subscriptions

Archetype is a powerful, reliable purchase server with cross-platform support. Our open-source framework provides a backend and a wrapper around Stripe to make implementing API keys and creating quotas and subscriptions easy. 

Whether you are building a new API or already have millions of customers, you can use Archetype to:

-   Fetch products, make purchases, and check subscription status with our  [native SDKs](https://docs.getarchetype.io/docs/installation).
-   Host and  [configure products](https://docs.revenuecat.com/docs/products)  remotely from our dashboard.
-   Analyze the most important metrics for your app business  [in one place](https://docs.getarchetype.io/docs/analytics).
-   See customer transaction histories, chart lifetime value, and  [grant promotional subscriptions](https://docs.getarchetype.io/docs/customers).
